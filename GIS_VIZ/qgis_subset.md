## Creating data subsets

**There are typically two situations where you want to create a subset of the features in a data source :

1.You want to reduce the amount of data to make a clearer display (KISS)

2.You want to export a subset of a larger data set to either edit it or just make display quicker

There are two somewhat **different approaches to subsisting data

1.**Filter** a data set, typically used if you only need the subset.

2.Creating a **selection set**, typically used if you want to proses the subset in a different way than the rest of the data.
