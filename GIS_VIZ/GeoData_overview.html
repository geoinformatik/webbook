<h2>Overview of how to represent spatial information using GeoData</h2>
<p>The first problem we have to address when trying to represent information about the spatial and temporal arrangement of things is that there are infinitely many things and they can be represented with infinitely large precision both spatially, temporally and thematic (the description of what the thing is). This is naturally not possible in a digital representation. We, therefore, have to go through some steps of abstraction and simplification in order to arrive at something that can be represented as digital data.</p>
<h4><a id="ontology"></a>Creating an ontology</h4>
<p>In the first step of abstraction, we decide which things are to be represented we call this an ontology (Greek and meaning what really exists). Only things that are stated in our ontology are represented everything else is ignored. &nbsp;In addition to stating what the things we can see the ontology also states which properties of the thing we will observe i.e. if the ting is a house will we observe the height of the house and the material of the roof or just that there is a house present at this location. Designing an ontology can be a complex task and is covered in a later section on designing an ontology (link).</p>
<h4>Representing space using&nbsp;<a id="ddiscrete_elements"></a>discrete elements</h4>
<p>The next step of simplification tries to solve the problem that space is continuous and we, therefore, must find a way of representing it using discrete units. &nbsp;There are two alternative methods for this In the first method named tessellation we register what is present at a set of predefined locations, typically but not necessarily distributed in a rectangular grid. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The other approach is to represent the boundaries of the things (more correctly named entities) using 0,1,2 or 3-dimensional geometries and then save the boundary together with the description of the entity. A zero-dimensional geometry is a point typically use to represent thing with a small extranet e.g. a tree, lamp pole or a manhole. A one-dimensional geometry is a line, typically used to represent elements with a small width, for instance, a road or a steam. Two-dimensional geometries are areas, typically used to represent entities with a spatial extent e.g. towns etc. 3-dimensional geometries are beginning to be used to represent buildings, trees and other elements primarily for photo-realistic 3D rendering. Please note that all these geometries can be placed in 2 or 3-dimensional space.</p>

<p>Both of these methods have their pros and cons, generally speaking, tessellation is best for describing properties that vary through space such as elevation temperature etc while vector representation is best for well-defined entities i.e. buildings, roads, etc. For a more detailed description of these representations, methods see (link)</p>
