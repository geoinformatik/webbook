# Introduction to maps and other types of visual narratives.
In this section we will look at some of the basic concepts relating to visual communication and especially the creation of visual narratives. Given the context much emphasis will be placed on using spatial data in visual narratives. 
Some common concepts to start out with

* A (data) visualisation is a single map, chart, diagram or image

* A visual narrative typically consists of one or more related visualisations some text components that collectively enables the user to follow a narrated data exploration.

* Infographics is typically heavier narrated and less explorative in the nature.

# The process of designing a visual narrative

# You
![](https://geoinformatik.github.io/webbooks/GIS_VIZ/viz_res/DesignProcesStep1.png)
* Resources
  * Time
  * Communicative and analytic skills
  * Knowledge
  * Data processing and visualisation tools
* Purpose / Intent
  * Data exploration
  * Arguing a specific view (Closing discussions)
  * Pointing to a issue (Opening discussions)



# Clarify what information you want to present

*  Clarify a few key aspects of the story are to go into the visual narrative.
*  It is not about how much information you can put into the narrative it is a question about what information the audience can get out.
*  A narrative can contain several layers of information, 
*  Think of the information in terms of a hierarchy that the user can drill down through at will



# Understand the target audience

* How much energy do they want to use on your narrative.
* What is their culture (jargon, preferences) 
* What is their domain knowledge
* their data literacy
* How do you think they will want to “reader” (use) your visual narrative. 
* Impairments (colour blindness



# World of discourse (Domaine)
![](https://geoinformatik.github.io/webbooks/GIS_VIZ/viz_res/DesignProcesStep4.png)
* What is the ontology of domain i.e. what is a forest.
* What is the jargon of the domain
* How is this domain typically visualised
* Which aspects of the domain can quantified and by which measures



# Media
![](https://geoinformatik.github.io/webbooks/GIS_VIZ/viz_res/DesignProcesStep5.png)
* Interactive vs static
* Imbedded or stand alone
* Synoptic or progressive (Turn the next page)
* Physical properties (paper, screen, projector) large small
* Surroundings (quiet or noisy)



# Data (in this context)
![](https://geoinformatik.github.io/webbooks/GIS_VIZ/viz_res/DesignProcesStep6.png)
* Data is the symbolic representation of information
* Types of data (User perspective):
  * Atomic values
    * Categorical (nominal, ordinal)
    * Quantitative (interval, ratio )
  * Complex Data
    * Data where the information is represented by a complex but well defined structure i.e. the outline of a municipality
  * Unstructured Data
    * Data where the information is indirectly represented i.e. a photograph of who where present at a event
 * Presence of time or space, connectivity (network)

# The visual narrative

![](https://geoinformatik.github.io/webbooks/GIS_VIZ/viz_res/DesignProcesStep7.png)
* How do you think the target audience will want to “reader” (use) your visual narrative. 
* Never lie, and remember that however you design your narrative you will be leading the reader in a specific direction.
