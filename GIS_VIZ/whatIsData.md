# What is data
*  Data is commonly defined as a symbolic representation of information.
*  Data thus stores information and information can be extracted from data.
*  Advocates of the knowledge triangle believe that knowledge can be obtained from information, but remember that there is such a thing as misinformation.

# How data represents information
* Data as we use it typically comes in the form of <span style="color: #0000ff;">values</span> that define <span style="color: #ff0000;">properties</span> of <span style="color: #ff00ff;">entities</span>. i.e. the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> highest completed education</span> of <span style="color: #ff00ff;">person_1</span> is a <span style="color: #0000ff;">masters program</span>.
* Another bit of data could specify that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gender</span> of <span style="color: #ff00ff;">person_1</span> is <span style="color: #0000ff;">female</span>.
* Note that the entity can be just a spatial location so the data could be of the form the <span style="color: #ff0000;">elevation</span> at<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> loacation_1</span> is <span style="color: #0000ff;">35</span> meters above sea-level.
