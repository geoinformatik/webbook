# What is data
*  Data is commonly defined as a symbolic representation of information.
*  Data thus stores information and information can be extracted from data.
*  Advocates of the knowledge triangle believe that knowledge can be obtained from information, but remember that there is such a thing as misinformation.

# How data represents information
*  Data as we use it typically comes in the form of <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">values</span></strong> that define <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">properties</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">entities</span></strong>. i.e. the<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> highest completed education</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">person_1</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">masters program</span></strong>.
*  Another bit of data could specify that the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">gender</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">person_1</span></strong> is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">female</span></strong>.
*  Note that the entity can be just a spatial location so the data could be of the form the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">elevation</span></strong> at<strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> loacation_1</span></strong> is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">35</span></strong> meters above sea-level.
